The title of our project is Halo API and it consists of a database filled with Halo information. Every group member really enjoys the Halo universe so we wanted to create an API revolving it! We couldn't find a Halo related API, so we decided to make our Blue Badge final project exactly that! Its similar to the Star Wars Swapi API, but in the Halo universe.
We wanted a dedicated database to store anything and everything about Halo. Whether that's the lifespan of an Unggoy (Grunt) or the home-world of the Sangheli, we wanted something that includes all of it. We utilized Visual Studio Community for the code with N-Tier Architecture and Postman to test our Endpoints.
We all have very different schedules, yet we were still able to get it complete early and add on a stretch goal. During this project, each team member learned the importance of exceptional communication along with how being as transparent as possible is pertinent to an application of this complexity to function properly
